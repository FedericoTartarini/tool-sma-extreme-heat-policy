    * Ensure pre-exercise hydration by consuming 6 ml of water per kilogram of body weight
    every 2-3 hours before exercise. For a 70kg individual, this equates to 420ml of fluid
    every 2-3 hours (a standard sports drink bottle contains 500ml).
    * Drink regularly throughout exercise. You should aim to drink enough to offset sweat
    losses, but it is important to avoid over-drinking because this can also have negative
    health effects. To familiarise yourself with how much you typically sweat, become
    accustomed to weighing yourself before and after practice or competition.
    * Where possible, select light-weight and breathable clothing with extra ventilation.
    * Remove unnecessary clothing/equipment and/or excess clothing layers.
    * Reduce the amount of skin that is covered by clothing – this will help increase your
    sweat evaporation, which will help you dissipate heat.

    * During training sessions, provide a minimum of 15 minutes of rest for every 45 minutes
    of practice.
    * Extend scheduled rest breaks that naturally occur during match-play of a particular
    sport (e.g. half-time) by ~10 minutes. This is effective for sports such as soccer/football and
    rugby and can be implemented across other sports such as field hockey.
    * Implement additional rest breaks that are not normally scheduled to occur. For example,
    3 to 5-min “quarter-time” breaks can be introduced mid-way through each half of a
    football or rugby match, or an extended 10-min drinks break can be introduced every
    hour of a cricket match or after the second set of a tennis match.
    * For sports with continuous play without any scheduled breaks, courses or play duration
    can be shortened
    * During all breaks in play or practice, everyone should seek shade – if natural shade is not
    available, portable sun shelters should be provided, and water freely available

        * Drinking cold fluids and/or ice slushies before exercise commences. Note that cold water
        and ice slushy ingestion during exercise is less effective for cooling.
        * Submerging your arms/feet in cold water.
        * Water dousing – wetting your skin with cool water using a sponge or a spray bottle helps
        increase evaporation, which is the most effective cooling mechanism in the heat.
        * Ice packs/towels – placing an ice pack or damp towel filled with crushed ice around your
        neck.
        * Electric (misting) fans – outdoor fans can help keep your body cool, especially when
        combined with a water misting system.
